            Have you ever laid on the floor of your apartment staring at the
            ceiling for hours? Have you ever wondered how many things you really
            need to grow up and die on this planet? Have you ever tried lying
            down and not trying harder than the bare minimum? <br />
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Some of us choose to lie down rather than be an exemplary member of
            society. We don&apos;t own a car, have a house, or support a family
            - we reject it all by lying down. This is not a trend. It is a
            statement. <br />
            <br />
            The term &apos;Lying Flat&apos;, or -tang ping-, was first coined in
            China as a movement that antagonizes the hegemonic worldview that
            says you have to work incessantly to achieve an ideal of success
            that is measured by accumulation and status.

            A viral post on the Internet in April 2021 brought it to the
            forefront of many minds, especially the younger generation. It has
            since gained immense traction in China and is spreading.

            On the social media platform Baidu Tieba, a man in his twenties
            wrote about his experience embracing this minimalist lifestyle for
            two years: <br />
            <br />
            “Life is just lying down, lying down and lying down,” he said in a
            post, titled <span className="italic">Lying Flat is Justice</span>.
