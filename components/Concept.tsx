        “Lying flat” is a movement about doing nothing. And that makes it about
        everything. For months, the chatter surrounding lying flat, or tang
        ping, has permeated Chinese society, sowed discourse and become
        ubiquitous enough to finally warrant a public condemnation by President
        Xi Jinping.

        “It is necessary to prevent the stagnation of the social class, unblock
        the channels for upward social mobility, create opportunities for more
        people to become rich, and form an environment for improvement in which
        everyone participates, avoiding involution and lying flat,” Xi said in
        comments published on October 15 by the Communist Party’s flagship
        journal on political theory, Qiushi{" "}

        “Lying flat” essentially means doing the bare minimum to get by, and
        striving for nothing more than what is absolutely essential for one’s
        survival.

        It represents the mindset of lying down instead of being a productive
        member of society. Rather than striving to study hard, buy a home, or
        even start a family, a subsection of society is rejecting it all to lie
        flat.

        Unlike many buzzwords that have come before it, “lying flat” does not
        represent a new fad. But a viral online post in April 2021 brought it to
        the forefront of many minds, especially the younger generation, and it
        has since gained immense traction in China.

        On the Baidu Tieba social media platform, a man named Luo Huazhong, in
        his mid-twenties, wrote about how he had embraced this lifestyle of
        minimalism for two years.

        “Life is just lying down, lying down and lying down,” he said in the
        post, titled “Lying flat is justice”.
